Microsoft Power BI Dashboard Project
This repository contains dashboards created using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboards provide an interactive view of key data and insights.

How to View the Dashboards
You have two convenient options to explore the dashboards:

Option 1: Open the Power BI File
If you have Power BI Desktop installed or a registered organizational account with Power BI Web, you can download and open the .pbix file directly from this repository.

Option 2: Watch the Screen Recording
A short video (2.5MB) is available for those who cannot download or open the file. This screen recording shows the interactive features of the dashboard in action.


Happy viewing!
